Tailor it to your needs, track emails, links and even replies. Email Tracking is a real money saver as you can manage your subscription in a few clicks and reduce costs for specific agents even for one day of downtime. Pay for actual usage, not for agent count!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/06/Exclusive-Reatures-ET.png\" alt=\"Email Tracking Exclusive Features\"></p>\n\n<p>See which clients are active email users and what fuels their engagement. Email Tracking for Zendesk Support is an application that offers tracking the exact time each email was opened.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Et-Gif-Mockup-New.gif\" alt=\"Email Tracking Introduction\"></p>\n\n<p>With the app, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>View read receipts with accurate information on when the emails or links were opened</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Disable tracking for specific users, tickets, organizations (NEW!)</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Get automated updates of internal custom fields when the client opens the email or you get a reply</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Add ‘unseen’ and ‘seen’ tags to tickets to create separate views for identifying problem tickets</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Analyze email performance with detailed and downloadable reports</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Use a wide number of app&#39;s settings to meet your needs</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Manage access from the app</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Receipt-ET.png\" alt=\"Read Receipt\"></p>\n\n<h3>Setup Checklist</h3>\n\n<p>To start tracking emails, ensure the following steps are completed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Enable Triggers</strong>: Email Tracking relies on triggers to initiate tracking processes. Make sure you&#39;ve enabled all the necessary triggers in the app.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Agent Authorization</strong>: All agents must be authorized within the Email Tracking app to ensure comprehensive tracking across your Zendesk account.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Enjoy automated Zendesk email tracking</h3>\n\n<p>Set up Email Tracking effortlessly and let it handle the job for you! Once configured, just sit back and analyze the data. See who you should give a call to prevent any issues or identify solid leads for your further follow-ups. Moreover, the tracking is available from Agent Workspace!</p>\n\n<h3>Track link openings</h3>\n\n<p>Now you can  <strong>track what links were opened</strong>  by recipients using an exclusive option available only in our email tracker app for Zendesk.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Apply-Link-ET.png\" alt=\"Select-Linl\"></p>\n\n<p>Select as many links as you need to follow and receive one more internal note with the one that was monitored. Also, check out the link statistics and compare agents&#39; performance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Link-Track-ET.png\" alt=\"Link Tracks Report\"></p>\n\n<h3>Disable tracking for specific tickets, users, organizations</h3>\n\n<p>Put a checkmark or add the tag to turn off tracking if your client asked about that.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/DO-Not-Track-ET.png\" alt=\"Disable Tracking\"></p>\n\n<h3>Additional ticket organization</h3>\n\n<p>Everything made so that you don’t even have to enter the ticket to know if it’s been seen or not! Email Tracking creates a custom field and a tag with ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ values. So, you can simply create separate views for read and unread tickets and build business rules (triggers and automations) to work with your customers’ information more accurately.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Seen-column-ET.png\" alt=\"Seen Unseen\"></p>\n\n<h3>Real-time notifications</h3>\n\n<p>As soon as an email is opened, Email Tracking updates a custom field connected to the ticket and adds a note with corresponding information. With push notifications enabled, you’ll be informed at the same second your email was opened.</p>\n\n<h3>Analyze performance in detail</h3>\n\n<p>Get a better understanding of how your replies perform with in-depth performance reports. For example, see what macros work better, what types of email users react to the most and check the overall bounce and open rates across the company, one or several agents at a time.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Mail-Tracks-ET.png\" alt=\"Reports\"></p>\n\n<h3>See full history of email opens</h3>\n\n<p>With Email Tracking, you are able to retain and see the whole ticket opens history, as the plugin tracks each time your emails were opened by the recipient. Follow the way how, when, and after which message the ticket was opened. The sidebar also shows if the ticket was read via desktop of mobile device, so it&#39;s even easier to optimize the messages now.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Stats-Timeline-ET.png\" alt=\"Statistics-Timeline\"></p>\n\n<h3>Send replies at the best times</h3>\n\n<p>Based on the open and reply rates, the plugin will suggest the best time for your agents to reach out to the customer directly in the ticket menu.</p>\n\n<h3>Comply with GDPR and CCPA</h3>\n\n<p>Click a single toggle, and Email Tracking will not track email opens for recipients who live in the European Union or California to  <strong>comply with GDPR</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Set app restrictions for agents</h3>\n\n<p>You can differentiate the access of each agent using our new feature - Access Control Management.

Tailor it to your needs, track emails, links and even replies. Email Tracking is a real money saver as you can manage your subscription in a few clicks and reduce costs for specific agents even for one day of downtime. Pay for actual usage, not for agent count!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/06/Exclusive-Reatures-ET.png\" alt=\"Email Tracking Exclusive Features\"></p>\n\n<p>See which clients are active email users and what fuels their engagement. Email Tracking for Zendesk Support is an application that offers tracking the exact time each email was opened.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Et-Gif-Mockup-New.gif\" alt=\"Email Tracking Introduction\"></p>\n\n<p>With the app, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>View read receipts with accurate information on when the emails or links were opened</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Disable tracking for specific users, tickets, organizations (NEW!)</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Get automated updates of internal custom fields when the client opens the email or you get a reply</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Add ‘unseen’ and ‘seen’ tags to tickets to create separate views for identifying problem tickets</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Analyze email performance with detailed and downloadable reports</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Use a wide number of app's settings to meet your needs</strong></li>\n<li>  <strong>Manage access from the app</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Receipt-ET.png\" alt=\"Read Receipt\"></p>\n\n<h3>Setup Checklist</h3>\n\n<p>To start tracking emails, ensure the following steps are completed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Enable Triggers</strong>: Email Tracking relies on triggers to initiate tracking processes. Make sure you've enabled all the necessary triggers in the app.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Agent Authorization</strong>: All agents must be authorized within the Email Tracking app to ensure comprehensive tracking across your Zendesk account.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Enjoy automated Zendesk email tracking</h3>\n\n<p>Set up Email Tracking effortlessly and let it handle the job for you! Once configured, just sit back and analyze the data. See who you should give a call to prevent any issues or identify solid leads for your further follow-ups. Moreover, the tracking is available from Agent Workspace!</p>\n\n<h3>Track link openings</h3>\n\n<p>Now you can  <strong>track what links were opened</strong>  by recipients using an exclusive option available only in our email tracker app for Zendesk.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Apply-Link-ET.png\" alt=\"Select-Linl\"></p>\n\n<p>Select as many links as you need to follow and receive one more internal note with the one that was monitored. Also, check out the link statistics and compare agents' performance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Link-Track-ET.png\" alt=\"Link Tracks Report\"></p>\n\n<h3>Disable tracking for specific tickets, users, organizations</h3>\n\n<p>Put a checkmark or add the tag to turn off tracking if your client asked about that.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/DO-Not-Track-ET.png\" alt=\"Disable Tracking\"></p>\n\n<h3>Additional ticket organization</h3>\n\n<p>Everything made so that you don’t even have to enter the ticket to know if it’s been seen or not! Email Tracking creates a custom field and a tag with ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ values. So, you can simply create separate views for read and unread tickets and build business rules (triggers and automations) to work with your customers’ information more accurately.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Seen-column-ET.png\" alt=\"Seen Unseen\"></p>\n\n<h3>Real-time notifications</h3>\n\n<p>As soon as an email is opened, Email Tracking updates a custom field connected to the ticket and adds a note with corresponding information. With push notifications enabled, you’ll be informed at the same second your email was opened.</p>\n\n<h3>Analyze performance in detail</h3>\n\n<p>Get a better understanding of how your replies perform with in-depth performance reports. For example, see what macros work better, what types of email users react to the most and check the overall bounce and open rates across the company, one or several agents at a time.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Mail-Tracks-ET.png\" alt=\"Reports\"></p>\n\n<h3>See full history of email opens</h3>\n\n<p>With Email Tracking, you are able to retain and see the whole ticket opens history, as the plugin tracks each time your emails were opened by the recipient. Follow the way how, when, and after which message the ticket was opened. The sidebar also shows if the ticket was read via desktop of mobile device, so it's even easier to optimize the messages now.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/02/Stats-Timeline-ET.png\" alt=\"Statistics-Timeline\"></p>\n\n<h3>Send replies at the best times</h3>\n\n<p>Based on the open and reply rates, the plugin will suggest the best time for your agents to reach out to the customer directly in the ticket menu.</p>\n\n<h3>Comply with GDPR and CCPA</h3>\n\n<p>Click a single toggle, and Email Tracking will not track email opens for recipients who live in the European Union or California to  <strong>comply with GDPR</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Set app restrictions for agents</h3>\n\n<p>You can differentiate the access of each agent using our new feature - Access Control Management. Agents can access the app's features entirely or partially.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://growthdot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/03/Manage-Access-ET-e1711542050472.png\" alt=\"Access control\"></p>\n\n<h3>Stay under cover</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re worried about how you can know for a fact that all opens are tracked correctly, you should not.
